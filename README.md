# hpp-runs

After launch a hpp-corbaserver, each Python script of this package can be executed to run "imax" number of times the problem. Each time, path is planned and then optimize by a Gradient Based method or a Random Shortcut.

Results such as computation times, solution costs are written in a 'results.txt' text file.

This file can be read with the parser in order to compute averages and SDs.
